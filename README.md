# Rogue-lite-project

So 2 scenes : 
- one for the game itself
- one for the playtest


first one : Scenes/ProceduralMap -> this is the game just lunch and play (WASD to move and left click to shoot, try to collect as many coins as possible AND don't mind the weird thing that appear sometime after killing an ennemy it's a place holder).

second one : Scene/TrainingRoomWithEnnemies -> go in this scene, lunch and move (WASD and left click) if you want to spawn some ennemies go in the scene onglet and click on the room prefab, you should see some button in the editor that pops some ennemies (they appear on the right side of this room).
